# DomoticsCodes

This is the codes that I use to my domotics projects

- ```cellier.io``` allow to send temperature from three ds18b20 sensors by mqtt and so by WiFi on my esp12e
- ```api.py``` allow me to get informations from my IPXv3 and my solar pannels ([AP System](https://apsystems.com)) using webscrapping, flask, and mqtt
